This is RSA-OAEP program   "Use Eclipse, Pleaseh, "read the last part of this file..."

Java specifications:
	Java data types are little bit different than other languages such as C, where Character is 16 bits, integer 32 bits

RSA-OAEP Specification:
	1- this program takes a message from user (14-character maximum) as input and does the following:
		a. Padding the message 
		b. Encrypt the padded message with 1024 bits primes and fixed value of e: 65537
		c. Decrypt the Encrypted message
		d. Depending the message
	2- the program will save everything except the output of the XOR results in text files, it is possible to access them outside the "src" folder
	3- the program is using outside files from other sources! the Credits of these supporting files will be at the end of this textfile
	4- wiener Attack is implemented to test if we can generate the secret key d, also indicates how well the primes are.

How to run:
	1- either import the jar file or import the RSA-OAEP folder as existing projects into workspace.
	2- Main class is MainRSA.java, run it as java application.
	3- no need external libraries
	4- console will show the output, and output folders will be saved outside src folder. 
		a. the files that being generated will replace each other every time you run the code!

	2- * GenPrime.java author Kim Dinh Son Email:sonkdbk@gmail.com

complementary materials:
	there will be two pictures of how the system flows, feel free to look at them. 


--------Issues:

	1- the exponent E is hardcoded, it is possible to be any prime,  2^k +1
	2- wiener attack will always fail since D > N^1/4 all the time due to the size of the exponent E is small
